Created the Project PremiumCalcluator with .Net core 3.1
So inherent issues with dot net core 3.1 such as duplicate attribute in the assembly file may arise in some scenarios

If so ,Pls add false in PremiumCalcluator.csproj changes

In case of time out while accessing the application due to spa options ,pls increase the time out in spa options in start up .cs

Developed code with Angular 8 ,so pls make sure all npm packages are with version (8)
